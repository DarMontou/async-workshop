            Welcome to <i>Get going with core.async</i>. The goal of this workshop is
            to help you become familiar with <code>core.async</code> to the level where
            you can start using it in your own projects.
        </p>

        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>An overview of the <code>core.async</code> library primitives</li>
            <!--<li>A catologue of usage patterns for building applications with <code>core.async</code></li>-->
            <li>Practical experience of building a simple chat application with <code>core.async</code> using both
                Clojure
                and ClojureScript
            </li>
        </ol>
