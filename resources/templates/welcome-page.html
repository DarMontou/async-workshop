        Welcome to <i>Get going with core.async</i>. The goal of this workshop is
        to help you become familiar with <code>core.async</code> to the level where

        In particular, this worksop should provide:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>An overview of the <code>core.async</code> library primitives</li>
        <li>A catologue of usage patterns for building applications with <code>core.async</code></li>
        <li>Practical experience of building a simple chat application using <code>core.async</code></li>
    </ol>

            take you step by step in building either a chat client in ClojureScript or
            a chat server in Clojure using <code>core.async</code>
        </li>
        <li>
            You can browse the included <a href="reference">reference</a>, to become more familiar with
