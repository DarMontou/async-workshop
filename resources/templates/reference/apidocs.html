    <h2>API reference</h2>
    <p>
      This page contains all of the documentation for the macros and functions available in <code>core.async</code>.
      As you use this reference, keep a few things in mind:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>If you are using Clojure, all of these vars will be found in <code>clojure.core.async</code>.</li>
      <li>
        If you are using ClojureScript, all functions will be found in <code>cljs.core.async</code> and all macros
        will be found in <code>cljs.core.async.macros</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        Some vars are only available in Clojure.  In particular, all those which require an actual thread or are
        blocking.  ClojureScript runs in a single-threaded environment, so those vars do not make any sense.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </section>
  <async-workshop-clojuredoc varname="go" ismacro="true" arglists="([& body])">
    <p>
      Asynchronously executes the body, returning immediately to the calling thread. Additionally, any visible calls
      to &lt;!, &gt;! and alt!/alts! channel operations within the body will block (if necessary) by 'parking' the calling
      thread rather than tying up an OS thread (or the only JS thread when in ClojureScript). Upon completion of the
      operation, the body will be resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returns a channel which will receive the result of the body when completed"
