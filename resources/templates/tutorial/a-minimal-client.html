        <h2 id="overview">A minimal client</h2>

        <p>
            In this first part of the tutorial, we will add core.async to a ClojureScript application to handle
            callbacks from a JavaScript application. To do this, we will:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Create an event handler that will input events into an async channel.</li>
            <li>
                Once the application is running, we will need to run an event loop that handles events from the
                socket.
            </li>
            <li>Finally, we will shut down the channel when the application is getting shut down.</li>
        </ol>

            Before moving on, be sure that you have successfully set up your development environment. Additionally, you
            will need to check out the branch <code>a-minimal-client</code> in the repository. This is your starting
            point. If you checked the project out from GitHub, this should be the default branch.

        <section id="about-the-app">
            <h2>About the application</h2>

            <p>
                While it's not necessary to understand everything about the application, there are a few things that may
                be helpful for you to know.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The server uses <a href="https://github.com/cemerick/friend"><code>Friend</code></a> to
                    ‘authenticate’ a user before accessing the chat room. From that point on, the server knows who the
                    client is.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The application uses the Google Closure library for using WebSockets.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The application uses <a href="https://github.com/swannodette/om">Om</a> on the client side to render
                    controls, chat history, and manage the WebSocket. You do not need to understand how to use Om,
                    however.
                </li>
                <li>
                    At this point, when you log into the chat, you will not see any user interface elements. Instead,
                    you should only see a message appear in the browser console ‘opened_3’ and a message in the main
                    Clojure console noting you logged in.
                </li>
            </ol>

        <section id="socket-init">
            <h2>Socket initialisation</h2>

            <p>
                The first bit of code we will take a look at is the <code>make-init-state</code> function in
                <code>async-workshop.chat-demo.client.web-socket</code>, the namespace containing the code for the Om
                component that manages the WebSocket used to talk to the server.
            </p>
        <pre class="brush: clojure">(defn make-init-state
  []
  (let [socket (WebSocket.)]
    (ev/listen socket
               #js [WebSocket.EventType.CLOSED
                    WebSocket.EventType.ERROR
                    WebSocket.EventType.MESSAGE
                    WebSocket.EventType.OPENED]
               (fn [e]
                 (.log js/console (.-type e))))
    {:socket socket}))</pre>
            <p>
                This bit of code constructs a new WebSocket, adds a simple event handler, and returns a map of the local
                state for the Om component. We will need to make the following changes:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Import the <code>cljs.core.async</code> namespace</li>
                <li>Create a core.async channel using <code>chan</code></li>
                <li>Change the event handler to <code>put!</code> events into the channel</li>
                <li>Add the created channel to the returned state map</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Note that instead of placing the raw event onto the channel, you may wish to create your own event type
                by using maps. For example, the opened event could be <code>{:type :socket-opened}</code>. Two of these
                events have an extra detail:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>The error event contains a data property, accessible via <code>(.-data e)</code></li>
                <li>The message event contains a message property, accessible via <code>(.-message e)</code></li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                You can place these details in some other standard place in your map.  Creating this uniformity in the
                values you place in the channel will help later when you start handling events from different sources.
            </p>

        <section id="about-event-loops">
            <h2>About event loops</h2>

            <p>
                Now that the callbacks are inserted into a channel, how do we actually react to them? There are
                several ways to take the value out. What we will want to do is write an event loop that takes values
                out of the channel and acts on them. This looks like:
            </p>
            <pre class="brush: clojure">(async/go
  (loop []
    (when-let [value (async/&lt;! channel)
       ; do something…
       (recur)))</pre>
            <p>
                <code>go</code> is a macro and must be required in ClojureScript using <code>require-macros</code>
                from the <code>cljs.core.async.macros</code> namespace. This <code>(go (loop [] …))</code> is common
                enough that there is a dedicated <code>go-loop</code> macro. <code>go</code> runs asynchronously and
                returns a channel that will produce the result of the <code>go</code> expression.
            </p>

            <p>
                The <code>&lt;!</code> function takes a value from the channel. This function can only be used in the
                context context of a <code>go</code>. This will allow the loop to park until it has a value. It’s
                nice because it allow you to write code to appear as if the code blocks at that point without actually
                blocking.
            </p>

            <p>
                We use a <code>when-let</code> because the channel will always produce a non-null value. If we get a
                null value, that indicates the channel was closed. This also means you can not put a null value into
                a channel. If there is a chance the channel will produce a <code>false</code> value, you can use
                <code>when-some</code> instead, which was introduced in Clojure 1.6.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="write-a-loop">
            <h2>Write a loop</h2>

            <p>
                Now that we have covered the basics of writing an event loop using core.async, write one that will be
                launched from <code>startup</code>. It should react to the events from the web socket, and inform the
                user about them by appending them to the chat history. The chat history is part of the client’s global
                state managed by Om (which exists in an atom). To modify this state, we will use
                <code>om/transact!</code>, which functions as a combined <code>swap!</code> and <code>update-in</code>.
            </p>

            <p>
                For our example code, you can use something like
                <code>(om/transact! global-state [:chat-history] #(conj % msg))</code> where <code>global-state</code>
                is the global application state (the first argument to <code>startup</code>) and <code>msg</code>
                is the text you are interested appending to the history. Once you call this, Om will take care of the
                rest.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="clean-things-up">
            <h2>Clean things up</h2>

            <p>
                Once you have a running event loop, there is one last thing we should probably do. We should close
                the channel once we're done with it. This will cause the event loop we created to terminate cleanly
                and be garbage-collected. To do this, all you need to do is call <code>close!</code> on the channel.
                This idempotent call will cause the channel to longer accept new values, but will allow readers to
                continue reading values until the channel is exhausted.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="summary">
            <h2>Summary</h2>

            <p>
                At this point, you should have a client that just puts a message on the page notifying the user that
                the client has connected to the server. It is not much, but it is a good start. You should have
                learned:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Some of the basics of creating and using channels</li>
                <li>How to write a simple core.async event loop</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Now, it’s time to apply some of these things to the server side.
