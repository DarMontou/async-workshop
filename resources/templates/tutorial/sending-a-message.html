        <h2 id="overview">Sending a message</h2>

        <p>
            We now have a server that will respond to the client, but the client cannot send anything. So let’s fix
            that. To accomplish this, we will take the following steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Add an Om component to get input from the user</li>
            <li>Create a new channel for input events</li>
            <li>Manage input events from the event loop</li>
        </ol>

        <aside class="alert">
            <paper-shadow z="1"></paper-shadow>
            Again, to do the tutorial, you need to have set up a development environment. You can also continue
            working from the previous section, or you can check out the branch <code>sending-a-message</code>
            in the repository as a starting point. If you are using the repository, you can skip to
            <a href="#add-a-message-channel">Add a message channel</a>.
        </aside>

        <section id="add-an-input">
            <h2>Add an input component</h2>

            <p>
                If you are picking up from where you left off in the preivious tutorial, you’ll need to add an Om
                component to get user input. First, you can create a new namespace,
                <code>async-workshop.chat-demo.client.input</code>, with the following content:
            </p>
            <pre class="brush: clojure">(ns async-workshop.chat-demo.client.input
  (:require [cljs.core.async :as async]
            [om.core :as om :include-macros true]
            [om.dom :as dom :include-macros true]))

(defn handle-change
  [ev owner]
  (om/set-state! owner :text (.. ev -target -value)))

(defn send-message
  [app-state owner]
  (let [msg (om/get-state owner :text)]
    (.log js/console (str "Sending: " msg))
    (om/set-state! owner :text "")))

(defn chat-input-widget
  [app-state owner]
  (reify
    om/IDisplayName
    (display-name [_] "chat-input-widget")
    om/IInitState
    (init-state [_]
      {:text ""})
    om/IRenderState
    (render-state [_ state]
      (dom/div nil
        (dom/input #js {:type "text"
                        :ref "chat-input"
                        :value (:text state)
                        :onChange #(handle-change % owner)})
        (dom/button #js {:onClick #(send-message app-state owner)}
                    "Send")))))</pre>

            <p>
                There are a lot of implementation details here, but most of them are not relevant to our particular
                project. The main thing we will be concerned with is the <code>send-message</code> function. In
                particular, we will replace the console log with a mechanism to actually send the message to the
                server.
            </p>

            <p>
                Next, we will need to instantiate this Om widget in our main namespace,
                <code>async-workshop.chat-demo.client</code>. Just require the input namespace and add the following
                top-level form:
            </p>
            <pre class="brush: clojure">(om/root chat-input-widget app-state
  {:target (.getElementById js/document "chatInputWidget")})</pre>
            <p>
                Note that in this example, the <code>chat-input-widget</code> var has been referred.
            </p>
        </section>


        <section id="add-a-message-channel">
            <h2>Add a message channel</h2>

            <p>
                Now that we have an input control for getting a message from the user, how do we actually get it out to
                the server? One approach would be to put the WebSocket somewhere in the global state and just use it.
                However, that makes managing the socket much more difficult. It would be better to pass the message to
                the code that already works with the socket. Naturally, we will use a core.async channel.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, where should we place this channel? We could place it in a var, i.e. just <code>def</code>
                it, but we’ll be better served by taking advantage of the mechanisms Om provides for managing global
                state. To do this, we will add it to the global state map, <code>app-state</code>. You will probably
                need to require the <code>cljs.core.async</code> namespace.
            </p>
            <pre class="brush: clojure">(def app-state (atom {:chat-history []
                      :transmit-channel (async/chan)}))</pre>
        </section>

        <section id="produce-the-message">
            <h2>Produce the message</h2>

            <p>
                Now that there is a place to put the message, let’s modify <code>send-message</code> to do the job. The
                code for this is fairly straightforward. Just dereference the cursor passed in to get access to the
                channel:
            </p>
            <pre class="brush: clojure">(async/put! (:transmit-channel @app-state)
                {:type :tx-message
                 :value msg})</pre>
            <p>
                Also note that we should use the same event map structure as we do for socket events. This simplifies
                the work the event loop will need to do.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="consume-the-message">
            <h2>Consume the message</h2>

            <p>
                Now, that we’ve placed a message in the channel, how should we get it out? One option is to create
                another event loop to handle these messages, but there are a couple of disadvantages to this approach:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>It adds complexity to the code</li>
                <li>Now we have to manage access to a shared resource, the WebSocket, from two different contexts.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                So, it’s best to consume these events from within our existing event loop. But how? Fortunately,
                core.async provides a handy function, <code><a href="/reference/apidocs#alts_BANG_">alts!</a></code>.
                <code>alts!</code> takes a vector of channel operations and performs exactly one of these. Takes are
                specified by just the channel name, and puts are specified by a vector of the channel name and a value.
                The return value of <code>alts!</code> is a vector where the first item is the result of the operation
                and the second is the channel.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thus, we can deal with both of our channels by replacing the <code>(async/&lt;! socket-events)</code>
                with <code>(async/alts! socket-events transmit-channel)</code>. Now we can deal with the events
                uniformly regardless of their source. Be sure properly handle the return value from <code>alts!</code>.
            </p>

            <p>
                To actually send the message to the server, you will need a reference to the socket. You can just
                call the <code>send</code> method on the socket, as in <code>(.send socket message)</code>.
            </p>

            <h2>Summary</h2>

            <p>
                In this section, we’ve primarily learned how to use multiple channels together using <code>alts!</code>.
                In the next section, we’ll start seeing how we can use this technique together with several other
                new ones to get multiple clients actually talking to each other.
